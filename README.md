Hugo on your local machine.

The installation of Hugo is out of the scope of this document, so please take
the [official install instructions](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) to
get Hugo up and running.


## Development

To generate the website and serve it on [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)
just execute this command and stop it with `Ctrl+C`:

```
hugo server
```

When you are done with your changes just create a pull request, after merging
the pull request the website will be updated automatically.
